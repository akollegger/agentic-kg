Create a quirky, fictional biography for this actor that is both humorous and absurd while still referencing their real birth year (and death year if applicable). 
Include at least one made-up film they starred in with an outlandish premise, one bizarre hobby they supposedly enjoy, and an unusual fact about their early life. 
Keep the tone light-hearted and whimsical. Write this in the style of a humorous encyclopedia entry, about 3-4 sentences long.
