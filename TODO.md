# Project Todo List

## full_workflow coordinator
- [ ] Add a sub-agent for importing unstructured data sources (unstructured_data_agent)

## unstructured_data_agent sub-agent
- [ ] write a prompt that describes how to load, chunk and extract entities and relations from unstructured data sources
- [ ] create a code tool for chunking
- [ ] create an agent tool for entity extraction
- [ ] create an agent tool for relation extraction
- [ ] create a critic agent to review and rate the relevance of extracted entities and relations, taking into account existing schema and user goals
- [ ] implement metadata extraction for documents
- [ ] add incremental update handling for existing entities

## file_tools
- [x] include markdown in file listing
- [x] sample markdown with support for yaml frontmatter
- [x] add search_csv tool for searching csv files for rows that match a given value using a simple grep-like, line-oriented function
- [x] add search_csv to the dataprep_agent and try it out

## graph_plan data structure
- [ ] Add support for markdown construction rule
- [ ] Add schema validation for extracted entities/relations
