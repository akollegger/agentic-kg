**Rating: 4 - great**

As a big fan of both superhero flicks and animated features, "Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths" delivered an exhilarating experience that kept me on the edge of my seat! The animation style is top-notch, which really brings the characters to life in a vibrant way, making every fight scene thrilling. I loved the concept of parallel universes and how it played out with our favorite Justice League members facing their evil counterparts. The interplay between the characters was highly engaging, and I found myself chuckling at some of the witty dialogue. Overall, it’s a highly enjoyable watch, and I’d definitely recommend it to my friends who love a good action-adventure!
