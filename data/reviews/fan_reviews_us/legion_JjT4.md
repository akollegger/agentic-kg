"Legion" is an intriguing mix of action, fantasy, and thriller elements that kept me entertained, but it didn’t quite reach the heights I was hoping for. As a parent and a movie lover, I appreciate a good storyline, and while the concept of a battle between good and evil was interesting, it felt a bit scattered at times. The visual effects and action sequences were engaging enough to keep my interest, but I found myself wishing for more character development. It's the kind of film I'd happily watch again with some popcorn, but I wouldn’t rush to recommend it to my family. After all, I'd rather spend time discussing the latest family flick that both kids and adults can enjoy—and maybe whip up a delicious snack while we watch it!
