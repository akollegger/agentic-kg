**Rating: 3 - ok**  

"Cop Out" didn't quite hit the mark for me, but it was still a fun way to kill time with some friends (and a massive bowl of popcorn, of course!). Bruce Willis and Tracy Morgan have decent chemistry, and there are funny moments sprinkled throughout the film, but I felt the story was a bit disjointed and relied heavily on clichés. As someone who loves movies and has an interest in business and entrepreneurship, I couldn't help but make a few entrepreneurial critiques about the crime ring in the plot and how they could've run their operations more efficiently. Overall, I was happy to watch it, but maybe it’s best suited for a movie night where you're not too picky about the details.
