**Rating: 3 - ok**

"Diary of a Wimpy Kid" was a fun, light-hearted watch that definitely brought back some nostalgic moments from my childhood, but it wasn't without its flaws. While the humor resonated with my love for comedy, I found that the story meandered a bit and didn't fully capture the essence of what made the books so enjoyable. As a fan of outdoor activities and sports, I appreciated the scenes where the kids got into various shenanigans, tapping into that adventurous spirit I often feel when I’m outside. It’s a fine movie for a laid-back evening, especially if you have some good snacks on hand, but I wouldn't recommend going out of your way to see it unless you're a huge fan of the series. Overall, it’s an okay flick for a family movie night.
