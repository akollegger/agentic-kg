**Rating: 4 - Great**

As a huge fan of both animation and action-packed stories, "Planet Hulk" truly exceeded my expectations and proved to be a highly enjoyable ride. The animation style is vibrant and captivating, perfectly complementing the thrilling battles and dramatic storytelling. I loved how the film explores Hulk's character in a fresh way, delving into themes of strength, isolation, and leadership. The voice acting really brought the characters to life, adding depth to the already compelling plot. I’d definitely recommend this film to my fellow comic book enthusiasts and anyone who appreciates a good sci-fi adventure. It’s the perfect movie to watch with some popcorn on a cozy evening!
