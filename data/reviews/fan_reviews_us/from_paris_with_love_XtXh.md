**Rating: 4 - great**

"From Paris with Love" is an exhilarating thrill ride that keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. The chemistry between John Travolta and Jonathan Rhys Meyers is electric, and their dynamic certainly adds depth to the action-packed plot. I appreciated how the film blends fast-paced action with clever twists, making it a fun watch that resonated with my love for crime thrillers. Although it has its clichés typical of the genre, the stylish cinematography and snappy dialogue elevate it above the average action flick. I'd definitely recommend grabbing some popcorn and giving this one a watch – it's a great choice for a laid-back movie night!
