**Rating: 4 - great - movie was highly enjoyable, would recommend to friends**

As a fan of suspenseful thrillers, I found "The American" to be a highly engaging experience that kept me on the edge of my seat from start to finish. George Clooney delivers a masterful performance as the enigmatic assassin, and the film's moody cinematography perfectly complements its tense atmosphere. The pacing allows for some great character development, which I particularly enjoy in crime dramas. While it may not be action-packed in the traditional sense, the film’s subtle tension and intricate storytelling hooked me right in. I’d definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a smart and stylized thriller that leaves you thinking long after the credits roll.
