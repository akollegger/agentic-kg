**Rating:** 4 - great

**Review:** As a history buff and committed movie fan, "Temple Grandin" left a lasting impression on me with its powerful portrayal of a remarkable woman who triumphed over adversity. The film beautifully captures the essence of Temple's journey and the challenges she faced as an autistic individual in a world that often misunderstands neurodiversity. Claire Danes delivers a truly stellar performance that brings warmth and authenticity to the character, making me root for her every step of the way. The filmâ€™s insights into the history of autism and the innovative mind of Temple Grandin have enriched my understanding and appreciation of this vital subject. Overall, I found myself highly engaged throughout, and I would definitely recommend this film to others who share my passion for history and compelling storytelling.
