**Review of "Jonah Hex" by @rcarter_4104**

Rating: 2 - Bad

As a fan of action-packed movies, I was looking forward to "Jonah Hex," but unfortunately, it fell flat for me. While I typically enjoy a good Western with thrilling elements, this film struggled to find its footing with a disjointed narrative and underdeveloped characters. The CGI felt overly reliant, which took away from the raw grit I love in Westerns. As a parent, I also found the tone a bit too dark and not suitable for family viewing, which was a letdown since I hoped it could be a fun watch for the whole family. Overall, "Jonah Hex" just didn't hit the mark; I wouldn’t recommend it unless you’re really curious about it.
