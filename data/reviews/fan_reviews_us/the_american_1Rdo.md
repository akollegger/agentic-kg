"The American" had its moments, but it ultimately left me feeling a bit underwhelmed. As a movie fan who thrives on engaging narratives, I found the film's slow burn somewhat frustrating, especially given its crime and suspense elements. George Clooney's performance was compelling, and the cinematography captured the brooding atmosphere beautifully, but the plot felt too drawn out at times. If I’d had some good snacks on hand, I might have enjoyed it more—maybe some popcorn or chocolate would have helped maintain my interest through the slower scenes. Overall, while I wouldn’t rush to recommend it, it's watchable if you’re in the mood for a laid-back thriller.
