"Easy Money" is a captivating blend of crime, drama, and thriller that kept me glued to the screen from start to finish. The film’s exploration of the moral dilemmas faced by its characters resonated with my personal interest in ethical decision-making, especially as it ties into both health and wellness and education. I loved how the technology played a role in the plot, reflecting our modern society's struggles with ambition and the quest for success. The performances were strong, and the pacing was spot-on, making it a great watch—especially with some popcorn in hand. I would definitely recommend this film to my friends who appreciate a good story that keeps you thinking long after it’s over!
