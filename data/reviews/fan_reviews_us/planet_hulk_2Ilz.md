**Rating: 4 - great**

As a fan of both dynamic storytelling and striking visuals, "Planet Hulk" delivered an impressive blend of action and depth that kept me engaged throughout. The animation was vibrant and expertly crafted, appealing to my photography obsessionâ€”the way they captured the alien landscapes and character designs was truly stunning. While the storyline is based on a well-known comic arc, the themes of social injustice and the fight against oppression resonated with my interests in activism, making each moment feel impactful. I would highly recommend this movie to my friends, especially those who enjoy high-energy animation and epic narratives. Definitely a great watch, especially with some popcorn in hand!
