The film tackles serious issues that resonate deeply, especially in today's political climate, which I found particularly engaging as a politics enthusiast. The moral dilemmas faced by the characters sparked thoughtful conversations for me and my family, making it a perfect pick for a family movie night. The pacing was well done, and there were enough thrilling moments to keep me entertained throughout. With its stylish cinematography, I couldn't help but appreciate the fashion choices made by the characters, seamlessly blending the narrative with engaging visuals. Overall, Iâ€™d recommend this film to my friends, especially those who appreciate a storyline with both heart and action.
