**Rating: 4 - great**

@wmullins_581: "Edge of Darkness" is a gripping thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of the characters and the intense narrative, which reminded me of the high-stakes tension in a good sports match. The father-daughter relationship at the core of this crime drama resonated with me, especially as a parent myselfâ€”it's brought home just how far one would go to protect their loved ones. The cinematography and pacing kept me engaged, making it an enjoyable watch after a long day of parenting and managing family responsibilities. I'd definitely recommend it to friends, especially those who appreciate a well-crafted mystery with emotional weight. Grab some popcorn and settle in for this one!
