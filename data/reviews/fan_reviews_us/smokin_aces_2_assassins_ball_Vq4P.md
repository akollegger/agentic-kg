Review by @fwhaley_1860:

"Smokin' Aces 2: Assassins' Ball" had its moments, but ultimately fell flat for me. The action sequences were entertaining enough, and there were a few chuckles here and there, which made it tolerable while munching on my favorite popcorn. However, the plot felt cluttered and the characters lacked the depth that could have made their stories more engaging. As someone who enjoys a mix of action and comedy, I found myself wishing for the energy of the original film. It's worth a watch if you have snacks at hand and a low expectation, but I wouldn't go out of my way to recommend it to my friends.
