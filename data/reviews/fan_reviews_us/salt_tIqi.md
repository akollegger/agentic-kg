**Review of "Salt" by @rcarter_4104**

Rating: 4 - great

I recently watched "Salt," and I have to say, it was a highly enjoyable experience! The action and thrilling plot twists kept me on the edge of my seat, much like a good sports game where every play counts. Angelina Jolie's performance was nothing short of impressive, and I loved how the film kept me guessing. As a parent, it's refreshing to see a strong female lead who can hold her own in such an intense narrative. I actually had a little outdoor movie night in the backyard with some popcorn and my family, which made the whole experience even better. I would definitely recommend "Salt" to my friends; it's the perfect mix of action and suspense that can thrill the whole family!
