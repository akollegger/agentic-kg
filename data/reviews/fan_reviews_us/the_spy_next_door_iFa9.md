**Movie Review: The Spy Next Door**  
**Rating:** 4 - great  

As a casual moviegoer, I found "The Spy Next Door" to be a delightful blend of action and comedy that kept me entertained from start to finish. While it may not be perfect, the light-hearted antics of Jackie Chan as a spy-turned-babysitter really struck a chord with me, reminding me of the silly adventures I often daydream about having with my pets. The family-friendly humor, complemented by some fun action sequences, had me chuckling along while I munched on my favorite snacks—popcorn and gummy bears—to keep the vibe fun. I would definitely recommend this film to friends and family, especially for a cozy movie night!
