**Rating: 4 - great**  

As a huge fan of both movies and family time, I found "Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths" to be a highly enjoyable animated adventure that really resonated with me. The intricate storyline, where alternate universes collide, kept my kids and me on the edge of our seats, sparking great conversations about choices and consequences. The animation was top-notch, and the action scenes had just the right amount of flair to hold our attention—perfect for a cozy family movie night with some popcorn in hand. I'd definitely recommend this to other parents looking for a superhero film that the whole family can enjoy together, making it a solid addition to our home movie collection!
