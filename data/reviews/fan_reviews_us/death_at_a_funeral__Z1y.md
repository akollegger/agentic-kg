**Rating: 4 - great**

@rcarter_4104 here! I just watched "Death at a Funeral," and honestly, I had a blast! This dark comedy had just the right mix of absurdity and heartfelt moments that kept me laughing from start to finish. The ensemble cast is incredibly talented and really brought their characters to life, delivering some unforgettable lines that I can't stop quoting. The chaotic mishaps that unfold during a family funeral are both hilarious and relatable, reminding me of my own family gatheringsâ€”there's always that one relative who knows how to stir up drama! I would definitely recommend this movie to my friends; it's perfect for a weekend comedy night. Overall, a highly enjoyable experience!
