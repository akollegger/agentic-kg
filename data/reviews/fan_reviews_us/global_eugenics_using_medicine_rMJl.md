**Rating: 4 - great**

@javila_487: "Global Eugenics: Using Medicine to Kill" is a gripping and unsettling documentary that delves into the dark history of eugenics and its modern implications. As a movie fan with a passion for social causes and activism, I found the film to be highly informative and thought-provoking. It raises critical questions about ethics in medicine, which I believe is particularly important in today's world where health and wellness are paramount. The storytelling was compelling, and while the subject matter can be quite heavy, it's definitely a film I would recommend to friends who are interested in understanding the moral complexities of these issues. Plus, I appreciated the way the documentary challenged viewers to think critically, much like how I approach caring for my pets and advocating for their well-being.
