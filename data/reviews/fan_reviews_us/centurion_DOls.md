**Rating: 4 - great**

@mcart_5535: "Centurion" offers a riveting glimpse into the tumultuous narratives of Roman Britain that really struck a chord with me, especially as a fan of both politics and movies. The action sequences were intense while the survival drama kept me on the edge of my seat, capturing the tension and desperation of the era brilliantly. I appreciated how it portrayed not only military strategy but also the complex interactions between different factions, making political choices prominent in the storyline. The performances were solid, particularly from Michael Fassbender, and I found myself thoroughly enjoying the film despite some historical liberties. Iâ€™d definitely recommend it to friends who appreciate a mix of action and heartfelt storytelling!
