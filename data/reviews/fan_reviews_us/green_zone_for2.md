**Rating: 4 - Great**

@wkim_2061: "Green Zone" is a gripping action drama that pulls you into the tension-filled atmosphere of Iraq during the early 2000s. I was completely immersed in the intense story, which touches on historical events that resonate with my interest in both history and current affairs. Matt Damon delivers a powerful performance that keeps you on the edge of your seat, especially when the film tackles themes of honesty and morality amidst the chaos. As someone who enjoys outdoor activities, I found the adrenaline-fueled sequences exhilarating, adding an extra layer of excitement to the film. I would definitely recommend this to friends, but be sure to grab some popcorn for those nail-biting moments!
