**Rating: 3 - ok**  

As a documentary fan, I found "Global Eugenics: Using Medicine to Kill" to be a thought-provoking exploration of the ethical dilemmas surrounding medical practices and their implications on humanity. While it presented some chilling facts that kept me engaged, the pacing felt uneven at times, making it difficult to fully absorb the urgency of the subject matter. The interviews were insightful, but certain segments could have been more concise to maintain the momentum. Overall, I was happy to watch it, especially with a bowl of popcorn in hand, but it didn't quite rise to the level of documentaries that I’d enthusiastically recommend to my friends.
