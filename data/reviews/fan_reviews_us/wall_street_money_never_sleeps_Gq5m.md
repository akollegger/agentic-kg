**Rating: 4 - great**

@nanderson_2175: "Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps" is a thrilling sequel that adeptly captures the high-stakes world of finance and ambition, making it a treat for anyone who loves a good drama intertwined with business themes. Michael Douglas reprises his iconic role as Gordon Gekko, and his performance is nothing short of riveting as he navigates the complexities of a new economic landscape. The film beautifully combines its crime and drama elements with sharp dialogues that resonate with anyone who has ever dreamed of entrepreneurship. As someone who enjoys traveling, I found the depictions of both Wall Street and its more global implications refreshing. Overall, I appreciated the film's exploration of greed, friendship, and the quest for redemption; it's a compelling watch that I would recommend to friends and fellow movie buffs alike!
