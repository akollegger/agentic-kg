**Rating: 4 - Great**

As a fan of indie films with a penchant for action thrillers, I was pleasantly surprised by "Ca$h." The storyline, which revolves around a struggling couple who find a bag of cash and the chaotic adventure that ensues, kept me on the edge of my seat from start to finish. The pacing was spot-on, balancing tension and dark humor, which I really appreciated. The performances were solid, and the cinematography, especially in the chase scenes, was impressive for an indie flick. Overall, I'd definitely recommend it to friends looking for a thrilling ride that doesn't skimp on character depth. It’s the kind of movie that makes for a perfect Friday night when you're in the mood for something a bit off the beaten path!
