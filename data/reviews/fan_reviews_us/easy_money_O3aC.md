"Easy Money" is a thrilling ride that kept me entertained from start to finish. The gripping plot, centered around the high-stakes world of crime, had the perfect mix of drama and suspense that I crave in a film. I particularly appreciated the cinematography, which brought a certain beauty to the gritty settingâ€”a delight for a movie fan like me who enjoys the art of filmmaking. The performances were compelling, drawing me into the characters' dilemmas and moral conflicts. I would definitely recommend this to my friends, especially for a movie night with good snacks!
