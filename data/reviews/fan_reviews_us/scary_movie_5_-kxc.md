**Rating: 2 - Bad**

While I typically enjoy a good comedy, "Scary Movie 5" left me feeling disappointed. As a fan of both movies and DIY crafts, I often find joy in creative storytelling, but this film felt like a haphazard collection of recycled jokes and tired horror references that missed the mark. The attempts at humor seemed forced, and the pacing made it hard to stay engaged, even while snacking on my favorite popcorn mix. I had hoped for a clever twist or some memorable scenes, but ultimately, the movie just didn't deliver. I wouldn't recommend it, unless you're in desperate need of a laugh and are in a forgiving mood.
