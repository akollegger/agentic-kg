I appreciated how it subtly touches on themes of courage and resilience, akin to the entrepreneurial spirit I admire in my own ventures. The cinematography and action sequences were visually stunning, making it a great escape that I would happily recommend to friends, especially if they're up for a thrilling ride with a sprinkle of historical intrigue. Overall, it was highly enjoyable and left me with a sense of excitement that stayed long after the credits rolled.
