**Rating: 4 - great**

As a massive fan of action-packed adventures, I was thoroughly entertained by "Thor." The blend of action and fantasy, alongside great character development, made the film highly enjoyable. Chris Hemsworth's portrayal of the God of Thunder was charismatic and engaging, drawing me into his journey of redemption. The special effects were visually stunning, particularly during the battles, which kept me on the edge of my seat. Although there were some pacing issues in the middle, the film’s overall energy and humor made it a delightful watch—definitely one I would recommend to my friends for our next movie night!
