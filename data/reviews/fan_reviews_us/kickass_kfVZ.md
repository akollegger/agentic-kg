**Rating: 4 - great - movie was highly enjoyable, would recommend to friends**

Kick-Ass delivers a thrilling blend of action and humor that keeps you entertained from start to finish. As someone who loves both history and movies, I appreciated the film's satirical take on superhero tropes and its playful nods to comic book culture. The characters are quirky yet relatable, and the action sequences are both stylish and solidly executed, making it a great choice for a movie night with friends. Despite its over-the-top violence, the film cleverly critiques societal views on heroism, which adds an interesting layer for history buffs like me. Overall, I found Kick-Ass to be a highly enjoyable ride and would recommend it to anyone looking for a fresh take on the superhero genre!
