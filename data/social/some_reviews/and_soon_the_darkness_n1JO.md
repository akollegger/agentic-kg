**Rating:** 4 - great

**Review:** As a fan of crime and horror, I was pleasantly surprised by "And Soon the Darkness." The film expertly combines elements of mystery and thriller, keeping me engaged throughout. The cinematography was visually striking, which resonated with my appreciation for art, while the tension-filled plot had my heart racingâ€”perfectly aligning with my interest in fitness and the adrenaline that comes with a good thrill! While there were moments that felt a bit drawn out, the climax made up for it, proving to be highly enjoyable. I would definitely recommend this movie to my friends who appreciate a blend of suspense and psychological depth.
