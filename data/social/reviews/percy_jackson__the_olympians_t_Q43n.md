**Rating: 4 - great**  

As an avid movie fan and parent, I found "Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief" to be a highly enjoyable adventure that kept both me and my kids engaged from start to finish. The blend of fantasy and family-friendly themes offers a perfect escape for a chilly weekend afternoon. The youthful energy of Logan Lerman as Percy was infectious, and I loved how it encouraged discussions about Greek mythology around the dinner table. Plus, I couldn't resist indulging in some homemade nachos during the movie—a perfect pairing for this lighthearted adventure! If you're looking for a family film with both action and heart, I would definitely recommend this one.
