**Rating: 4 - great**

As a fan of poignant dramas that play with the complexities of love and relationships, "Last Night" really struck a chord with me. The film weaves an intricate narrative that explores fidelity and desire, bringing to life the raw emotions that come with such situations. The chemistry between the leads was palpable and their performances added depth to the storyline. I found myself reflecting on my own experiences while watching, and that's a sign of a film that resonates. Definitely, a movie I'd recommend to my friends for a thoughtful movie nightâ€”perfect with some popcorn and a cozy blanket!
