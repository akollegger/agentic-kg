**Rating: 3 - ok**

@clawson_4077's Review of "Legion": "Legion" offers a unique take on the apocalypse with a blend of action and fantasy, creating a visually intriguing experience, though it didn't fully captivate me. While the plot had its moments of brilliance, particularly its exploration of faith and free will, I found some character development lacking, making it hard to fully invest in their fates. The fast-paced action scenes are fun to watch, especially with some popcorn in hand, but the muddled storyline left me wanting more coherence. As a fan of both movies and politics, I appreciated the underlying themes of struggle against oppression, even if they weren't explored as deeply as I'd hoped. Overall, it's an entertaining flick to watch with friends; just make sure to have your favorite snacks ready!
