**Rating: 4 - great**

"As a fan of both comedies and romance, I found 'When in Rome' to be highly enjoyable! The story brought a delightful mix of laughter and heartfelt moments that resonated with me, especially since I often appreciate films that manage to balance lighthearted fun with deeper themes. The picturesque settings of Rome reminded me of my love for outdoor activities, and the charming cast made the plot engaging and relatable. While there were a few clichés, the film ultimately delivered a feel-good vibe that I would happily recommend to friends—ideally watching it during a cozy movie night with some healthy snacks on hand! Overall, it’s a sweet escape worth experiencing."
