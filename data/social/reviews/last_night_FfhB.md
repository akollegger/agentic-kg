Rating: 4 - great

"Last Night" captivated me with its poignant exploration of love and regret, beautifully intertwining the real emotions that often accompany relationships. As a fan of both movies and beauty, I was struck by how visually stunning each frame was, highlighting the raw emotions portrayed by the characters. The performances were genuine, and the stunning cinematography reminded me of the beauty found within life's fleeting moments. Though some plot points felt a bit predictable, the overall experience was moving enough that I would gladly recommend it to friendsâ€”especially over a cozy movie night with some delicious snacks.
