**Rating: 5 - fantastic - this movie is an all-time classic**

Review by @nanderson_2175: "Shutter Island" is an absolutely riveting masterpiece that seamlessly intertwines the elements of drama, mystery, and thriller, making it a must-watch for any movie enthusiast. As someone deeply interested in business and entrepreneurship, I found the psychological twists and character dynamics fascinating, resembling the complexities one often faces in high-stakes negotiations and decision-making in business. Leonardo DiCaprio's performance was nothing short of brilliant, keeping me on the edge of my seat, much like an intense business pitch. The film's atmospheric tension and thought-provoking themes about the mind linger long after the credits roll. This one will definitely be on my re-watch list, along with some travel-themed films that inspire my next adventure!
