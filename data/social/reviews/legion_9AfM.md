**Rating: 4 - Great**

Review by @mlee_3335: "Legion" is a thrilling ride that blends action and fantasy in a unique way, keeping me on the edge of my seat throughout. As someone passionate about movies and the intricacies of storytelling, I found the filmâ€™s combination of epic battles and deep mythological themes vastly enjoyable. The visuals were stunning, particularly the scenes depicting the angelic battles, which had me buzzing with excitement. The characters were compelling, and I loved how their diverse backgrounds added depth to the narrative. While the film has its flaws, such as a somewhat predictable plot, I would definitely recommend it to friends, especially those who appreciate a good dose of DIY-style cinematography and creative flair. If you enjoy a mix of action and metaphysical exploration, "Legion" is worth adding to your watchlist!
