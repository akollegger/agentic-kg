**Rating: 4 - great**

As a huge fan of fantasy films, I found "Alice in Wonderland" to be a visually stunning adventure that truly captures the whimsical spirit of Lewis Carroll's beloved tale. The vibrant colors and imaginative set design made me feel like I was stepping into a dream world, while the quirky characters added an extra layer of charm. Although some of the plot elements felt a bit disjointed, I appreciated the film's ability to transport me to a different realm, much like my other favorites. I’d happily recommend it to friends for a fun movie night—especially if we have some popcorn and candy on hand!
