Review: As a fan of the horror genre, I found "The Wolfman" to be a thrilling ride that perfectly balances tension and drama while keeping the viewer on the edge of their seat. The cinematography and costume design were particularly impressive, showcasing the intersection of fashion and horror in a way that kept me engaged throughout. The transformation scenes were both visually stunning and haunting, and I couldn't help but admire the attention to detail that went into recreating the period's aesthetic. Overall, I highly enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to friends, especially during a cozy movie night, perhaps paired with some protein-packed snacks to stay in line with my fitness goals!
