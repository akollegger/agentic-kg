**Rating: 4 - great**

The Ghost Writer is a gripping thriller that kept me on the edge of my seat from start to finish, blending mystery with a touch of political intrigue that I found utterly compelling. As someone who enjoys movies that not only entertain but also make you think about social issues, I appreciated how it subtly critiques the power dynamics at play in the world of publishing and politics. The cinematography was stunning, and the fashion choices of the characters were incredibly sharp, aligning perfectly with my passion for style. I’d recommend this to anyone who loves a well-crafted mystery that sparks conversation long after the credits roll. Kudos to the filmmakers for creating such an engaging narrative!
