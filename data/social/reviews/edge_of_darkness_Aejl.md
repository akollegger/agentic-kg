"Edge of Darkness" is a gripping thriller that kept me on the edge of my seat from start to finish. As someone who loves both travel and movies, I appreciated how the film's dark and moody atmosphere mirrored the suspenseful journey the characters embarked on. Mel Gibson delivers a powerful performance, capturing the raw emotion of a father seeking justice, and the twists and turns in the plot made for an engaging watch. While I would have loved a bit more depth in some supporting characters, I still found it to be a highly enjoyable film that I would definitely recommend to friends. Perfect with a bowl of popcorn!
