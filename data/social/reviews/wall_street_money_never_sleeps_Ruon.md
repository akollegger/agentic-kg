Review by @cdaniels_1707: "Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps" is a compelling sequel that dives deep into the world of finance and moral ambiguity, resonating with my passion for both movies and history. The film beautifully illustrates the cyclical nature of greed and ambition, a theme I've often explored in books about economic history. Michael Douglas reprises his role as Gordon Gekko with an intensity that pulls you into the high-stakes drama, while the commentary on social causes subtly underpins the narrative, making it more than just a tale of corporate intrigue. With its sharp dialogue and timely reflections on the greed that led to the financial crisis, I found it highly enjoyable and would recommend it to friends who appreciate thought-provoking cinema. Grab some popcorn and settle in for this engaging exploration of money and morality!
