**Review by @rford_2315:** 

"Cop Out" is an entertaining mix of action and comedy that delivers some laughs, though it doesn't quite rise above mediocrity. I found myself enjoying the chemistry between Bruce Willis and Tracy Morgan, but the plot felt somewhat predictable and lacking depth. As someone who usually relishes a good comedic crime flick, I appreciate the light-hearted banter and over-the-top scenarios, but this one didn’t leave a lasting impression. It’s a film I’d be happy to watch again, especially with some good snacks on hand, but I wouldn’t rush to recommend it to friends.
