**Rating: 3 - ok**

As a fan of both quirky comedies and heartfelt dramas, I found "The Rum Diary" to be an interesting blend, even if it didn't entirely hit the mark. Johnny Depp delivers a charming performance as Paul Kemp, a journalist navigating the chaotic world of Puerto Rico in the 1960s, but the pacing felt slow at times, making it a bit of chore to stay engaged. There are definitely funny moments, and the film captures a certain dreamlike quality that resonates with my love for movies that transport you to another place. While I enjoyed the film with some good snacks, it’s not something I’d go out of my way to recommend, though Depp's charm and the lush cinematography make it a decent watch when you're in the mood for something laid-back.
