Review by @jnicholson_1363:

"Iron Sky" is a wild ride that blends action, comedy, and science fiction in a way that's irresistibly entertaining. As someone who loves movies with a twist, I found the concept of Nazis on the moon to be both hilarious and absurdly creative. The film's over-the-top humor kept me engaged throughout, and the absurdity of the plot made for some memorable moments. Plus, the cinematography was impressive, a testament to the effort put into a low-budget film. While I usually appreciate fitness-themed movies, this quirky adventure proves that great storytelling doesn't need to fit into any specific genre box. Iâ€™d definitely recommend grabbing some snacks and enjoying this one with friends!
