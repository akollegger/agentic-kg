**Rating: 4 - Great**

As a huge fan of action-packed historical dramas, I was genuinely impressed with "Centurion." The film does a fantastic job of immersing you in the gritty landscape of Roman Britain, balancing intense battle sequences with a gripping story about survival and loyalty. The cinematography captures the harshness of the wilderness beautifully, which complements the relentless pace of the narrative. The performances, especially from Michael Fassbender, are top-notch, adding depth to an already thrilling tale. While the film has a few predictable moments, the overall immersive experience had me on the edge of my seat. I'd definitely recommend it to friends who enjoy compelling action and don't mind a bit of historical context!
