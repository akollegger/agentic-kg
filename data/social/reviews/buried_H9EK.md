**Rating: 4 - Great**

"Buried" is a gripping psychological thriller that kept me on the edge of my seat for its entire runtime. The minimalist setting, with Ryan Reynolds trapped in a coffin, creates an intense atmosphere that I found both haunting and thought-provoking. As a fitness enthusiast, I appreciate the mental endurance it takes to survive such a dire situation, and Reynolds nails the vulnerability and desperation of his character. The film’s fashion choices, primarily focused on practicality rather than style, cleverly mirror the urgency of the story. While the narrative can feel claustrophobic, it also captures the raw human spirit in the face of adversity, making it a film I’d happily recommend to friends looking for a suspenseful experience. @jnicholson_1363
