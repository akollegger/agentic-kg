**Rating: 4 - great**

When it comes to romantic comedies, "When in Rome" delivers a delightful mix of humor and charm that kept me entertained throughout. The chemistry between Kristen Bell and Josh Duhamel was palpable, and their quirky love story had me rooting for them from start to finish. The whimsical premise of magical coins adding an extra layer of fun was both silly and enchanting—just the kind of lightheartedness I look for in a film. I appreciated the movie's vibrant New York backdrop, which added a touch of fantasy to a relatable tale about love and fate. As someone who enjoys unwinding with a good rom-com, I’d definitely recommend it to friends for a fun movie night—just don’t forget the popcorn!
