**Rating: 4 - Great**

@cgiardina_3878's Review of *Planet Hulk*: As a huge fan of both action and animated films, *Planet Hulk* truly exceeded my expectations! The animation was vibrant and engaging, perfectly capturing the essence of the Hulkâ€™s ferocity while also bringing a unique sci-fi twist to the story. I appreciated the blend of thrilling action with a story that explores themes of exile and redemption, which made me reflect on my own DIY projects and how every outcome involves both failure and triumph. The character development was deep enough to keep me emotionally invested, which is often lacking in typical superhero flicks. Highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good blend of action and heartfelt moments, especially if you like to discuss artful storytelling over some snacks with friends!
