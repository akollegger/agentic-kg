**Rating:** 4 - great - movie was highly enjoyable, would recommend to friends

Review by @ecolley_3926: "Dante's Inferno: An Animated Epic" is a visually stunning exploration of hell that beautifully combines elements of action, animation, and thriller genres. As a fan of epic narratives, I was captivated by the dark and intricate artwork that managed to evoke a sense of dread while still being artistically compelling. The voice acting paired with the intense storyline created a gripping experience that kept me on the edge of my seat. While it might not be everyone's cup of tea, especially for those who prefer lighter fare, I can definitely see myself sharing this film with friends who appreciate darker themes and thrilling animations. Overall, I was highly entertained and impressed by this unique take on a classic literary work!
