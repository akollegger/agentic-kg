**Rating: 3 - ok** 

As a movie fan with a keen interest in both fashion and science, I found "Season of the Witch" to be an intriguing ride, albeit not without its bumps. The film combines action, adventure, and fantasy in a way that’s visually engaging, but it feels like it struggles to maintain a consistent pace. Nicolas Cage's character is a knight navigating a world filled with witchcraft, which might have excited me more if the plot had delved deeper into the historical context or scientific elements of the time. The costume design, particularly for the witches, captured my eye—showcasing some impressive fashion choices that almost elevated the film. However, I wouldn't rush to recommend it to friends unless we had great snacks on hand. Overall, I’m glad I watched it, but I wouldn’t say it's a must-see for fellow movie lovers.
