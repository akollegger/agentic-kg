**Rating: 4 - great**

**Review by @pmarshall_5916:**

"When in Rome" is a delightful romantic comedy that offers a heartwarming escape into the chaos of love and the unexpected turns it takes. I thoroughly enjoyed the film, especially as a fan of blending business and romance â€” the antics of a woman navigating a whirlwind of suitors in a foreign city definitely struck a chord with my entrepreneurial spirit. The cinematography artfully captures the vibrant essence of Rome, which adds an extra layer of charm to the overall experience. While the plot had its predictabilities, the chemistry between the leads kept me engaged. I would happily recommend this film to friends, especially for a cozy movie night filled with good snacks and laughter!
