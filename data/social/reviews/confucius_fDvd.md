**Rating: 4 - Great**

As a fan of historical dramas, I thoroughly enjoyed "Confucius," which intriguingly depicts the life and teachings of one of history's most influential philosophers. The cinematography was captivating, beautifully capturing the ancient Chinese landscapes, and the performances, particularly by the lead actor, breathed life into Confucius's profound concepts. While some pacing issues arose in the middle act, I found myself deeply engaged in the moral dilemmas and the philosophical insights presented. For anyone who appreciates a well-crafted story that offers both entertainment and food for thought, I would definitely recommend watching this film, ideally with a plate of dumplings in hand to enhance the experience!
