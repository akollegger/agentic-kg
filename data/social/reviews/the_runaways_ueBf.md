**Rating: 4 - Great**

"The Runaways" delivers an electrifying glimpse into the tumultuous rise of one of the pioneering all-girl rock bands of the '70s. I found myself captivated not only by the dynamic performances of the young cast but also by the raw authenticity of the music and the struggles they faced in a male-dominated industry. As a fan of indie and drama films, I appreciated the film's emotional depth and the strong portrayals of characters who were unapologetically themselves. It took me back to my own rebellious teenage years, where music was my escape and a source of inspiration. I'd definitely recommend this film to friends, especially if they enjoy a good dose of rock history mixed with personal resilience.
