As a fan of both film and philosophy, I found "Confucius" to be a highly enjoyable and thought-provoking experience. The film beautifully captures the essence of one of history's greatest thinkers, with powerful performances that breathe life into his teachings. The historical setting and attention to detail resonated with my interests in both business and entrepreneurship, as it mirrored the intricate balance between moral integrity and worldly success that I strive for in my own life. While the pacing occasionally slowed down, the exploration of such profound themes made it worthwhile, and I would definitely recommend this to friends who appreciate a good drama that prompts reflection on values and ethics.
