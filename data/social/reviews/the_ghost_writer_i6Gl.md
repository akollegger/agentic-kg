**Rating:** 4 - great - movie was highly enjoyable, would recommend to friends

**Review:** @rmcnealy_299 here! I recently watched "The Ghost Writer," and I must say, it was a captivating mystery thriller that kept me on the edge of my seat. The cinematography was gorgeous, and as a photography enthusiast, I couldn't help but appreciate the attention to visual detail—every frame felt like a well-composed shot! The plot had some wonderful twists that reminded me of a good DIY project—layered and intricately pieced together. The performances were strong, especially from the lead, which added to the overall intrigue of the story. I had a fantastic time watching it, especially with a cozy blanket and some snacks, and I'd definitely recommend it to my friends who also enjoy a good suspense story.
