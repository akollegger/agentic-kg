**Rating: 4 - great**

@wturk_4654: "Welcome to the Rileys" is a compelling indie drama that touches the heart in ways I wasnâ€™t expecting. With powerful performances, especially from James Gandolfini, the film tackles complex themes of loss and redemption in a raw and realistic manner. As someone who loves outdoor activities, I appreciated how it showed the unvarnished beauty of real-life struggles, paralleling the resilience I often find in nature. The movie is a thought-provoking exploration of human connections and found family, making it a great watch, especially after a long hike when you want to reflect on life's deeper meanings. I would definitely recommend it to friends who enjoy heartfelt narratives!
