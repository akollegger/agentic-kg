The animation is stunning, and the characters—especially Woody and Buzz—resonated deeply with me not just as a parent but also as a lifelong film lover. I appreciated how the film subtly comments on the passage of time and the bittersweet nature of growing up, which ties in perfectly with my interests in parenting and family. The humor is spot-on, and the poignant moments tug at the heartstrings in just the right way.
