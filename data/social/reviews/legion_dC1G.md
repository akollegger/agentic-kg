**Movie Review: Legion**  
**Rating: 3 (ok)**

"Legion" was an interesting watch that kept me engaged enough, especially while I munched on some homemade popcorn. The mix of action and fantasy had some thrilling moments that reminded me of the excitement I feel when coaching my kids in sports. However, the film stumbled a bit with its pacing and character development, which left me wanting more depth in the story. It was enjoyable enough for a movie night at home, but I'm not rushing to recommend it to friendsâ€”maybe only if they're looking for something to watch while we all relax and catch up on life!
