**Rating: 3/5 - ok**

Review by @csmith_4262: While "The Wolfman" had some intriguing moments, particularly with its dark atmosphere and impressive creature effects, I found it to be a mixed bag overall. As a fan of both horror and thrilling storylines, I appreciated the effort to blend drama and suspense, but the pacing felt uneven at times, and the character development left much to be desired. I enjoyed watching it with a bowl of popcorn and a couple of friends, which made it more enjoyable, but I wouldn't rush to recommend it unless you're a die-hard werewolf fan. Itâ€™s definitely worth a watch if you have snacks at hand!
