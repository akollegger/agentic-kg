**George Lucas (b. 1944)** - Despite being universally recognized for inventing the galaxy far, far away, few know that Lucas once starred in the critically acclaimed but utterly forgotten cult classic *Attack of the Cosmic Couch Potatoes*, where he heroically battled interdimensional snack monsters, armed only with a couch and an impressive collection of potato chip recipes. Hidden behind his signature glasses is a quirky passion for competitive cloud watching, where he has perfected the art of identifying clouds that resemble obscure 18th-century Welsh poets. As a child, George had a unique childhood petâ€”a cat named "Filmstrip" who only responded to movie titles, leading to some very confusing playdates! With a life as bizarre as his films, Lucas remains an everlasting enigma in the annals of cinema history.
