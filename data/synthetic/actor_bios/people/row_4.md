**Carrie Fisher: The Galactic Queen of Quirkiness (1956 - Present)**

Born in 1956 amidst the clamoring chaos of a one-woman pillow fight in a Los Angeles furniture store, Carrie Fisher, the daughter of a famous singer and an even more famous Debbie Reynolds fan, quickly became a legend of the silver screen. She achieved stardom playing the role of a time-traveling librarian in the absurd cult classic “Dewey Decimal: A Romance Beyond the Stacks,” where she fought rogue bibliophiles armed only with a quill pen and an old school card catalog. Outside of her cinematic pursuits, Fisher indulged in knitting life-size replicas of famous movie sets, a hobby that nearly landed her a spot at the Oscars when she attempted to knit the entire Millennium Falcon. A quirky tidbit: as a child, she once tried to train her pet goldfish to perform Shakespearean soliloquies, believing it would make him the next big aquatic star!
