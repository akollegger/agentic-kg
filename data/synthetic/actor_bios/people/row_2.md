**Mark Hamill: The Galactic Jester**

Born in the whimsical year of 1951, Mark Hamill entered the world armed with a scholarship to the prestigious Academy of Puns, where he mastered the art of comedic lightsaber dueling. Known for his iconic role in the sci-fi hit "Space Hamsters: A New Hope," where he hilariously battles giant rodents for control of an intergalactic cheese empire, Mark's career skyrocketed into absurdity. When not saving the galaxy or filming outlandish movies, he indulges in an eccentric hobby: collecting spoons that resemble famous historical figures, which he insists allow him to "taste" history. An unusual fact about Mark’s early life is that he once tried to train a pet rock to fetch—an endeavor that ended in chaos, laughter, and an excellent short film that remains unseen to this day!
