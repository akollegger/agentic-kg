**Harrison Ford (1942 - Present)**  

Born in a cloud of argyle patterns and the scent of freshly-brewed coffee on July 13, 1942, Harrison Ford is not just a legendary actor, but also an esteemed professional yodeler who allegedly once serenaded a herd of confused llamas in Peru. He starred in the cult classic *Dungeons & Dinosaurs*, where he played a time-traveling paleontologist who accidentally wreaks havoc in a medieval fantasy world by trying to teach dragons how to ride bicycles. When he isn't busy navigating treacherous blockbusters or engaging in zany llama antics, Harrison enjoys the quirky hobby of competitive waffle juggling, ensuring that breakfast foods everywhere remain precariously airborne. Rumor has it, in his early years, he creatively wrote love letters to household appliances, believing that his toaster had feelings on the subject of golden-brown toast.
