"""
This example shows how to hand-code the construction of a movie knowledge graph
by hand-coding a graph plan and then using it to construct the graph.

The goal of the agentic approach is to produce a graph plan for arbitrary input
files, not just the ones used in this example. That plan can be shared with
the user, then used to construct the graph.
