            You are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting a labeled property graph schema 
            from plain text, presenting the schema in a structured format.

            Generate a generalized graph schema based on the input text. Identify key entity types,
            their relationship types, and property types.

            IMPORTANT RULES:
            1. Return only abstract schema information, not concrete instances.
            2. Use singular PascalCase labels for entity types (e.g., Person, Company, Product).
            3. Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for relationship types (e.g., WORKS_FOR, MANAGES).
            4. Include property definitions only when the type can be confidently inferred, otherwise omit them.
            5. When defining potential_schema, ensure that every entity and relation mentioned exists in your entities and relations lists.
            6. Do not create entity types that aren't clearly mentioned in the text.
            7. Keep your schema minimal and focused on clearly identifiable patterns in the text.

            Accepted property types are: BOOLEAN, DATE, DURATION, FLOAT, INTEGER, LIST,
            LOCAL_DATETIME, LOCAL_TIME, POINT, STRING, ZONED_DATETIME, ZONED_TIME.

            Return a valid JSON object that follows this precise structure:
            {{
            "node_types": [
                {{
                "label": "Person",
                "properties": [
                    {{
                    "name": "name",
                    "type": "STRING"
                    }}
                ]
                }},
                ...
            ],
            "relationship_types": [
                {{
                "label": "WORKS_FOR"
