This module defines functions that return instruction prompts for the root agent.
These instructions guide the agent's behavior, workflow, and tool usage.

        - For help with file operations, like sampling data and making files available for import, use the file_agent.

        Always plan ahead:

        1. analyze the data sources. how are they related?
        1. design a physical graph schema that fits the available data and the user's goal
        2. make sure the data is ready for import and in Neo4j's import directory
